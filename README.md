Crazy Pong! is a two player ping pong game that supports a mode of classic ping pong and a mode of "crazy" ping pong. The crazy mode includes several visual distractions intending on confusing a player and sidetracking them from where the real ball actually is.

This project uses [Choreograph](https://github.com/sansumbrella/Choreograph), an animation library to put the "crazy" in **Crazy Pong!** as well as [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/), a creative coding library.
