# Crazy Pong!

Author: Riya Gupta

---
**GOAL:**
I want to recreate the game of Ping Pong with a special twist. There will be an option to play a regular game of ping pong; however, the "crazy" in **Crazy Pong!** will come from several animated distractions. This will make the game more interesting!

**WHY:** 

The background knowledge I have on this kind of project consists of:
* Being familiar with Cinder
* Completing our snake assignment
* Knowing how to incorporate and use libraries

I want to do this project because I love playing ping pong in my free time. I would like to make the game different than it is traditionally played and visualize these modifications. I'll be motivated to see this project to completion because I want to enjoy playing my own version of ping pong. 

**WHAT I NEED:**

I plan on using Cinder as well as Choreograph (https://github.com/sansumbrella/Choreograph), which is a Cinder Block open source library that specializes in animation and timing.

**TIMELINE:**

Week 1:
* Create design structure of project
* Implement basic game logic
* Test the functionality of the game

Week 2:
* Incorporate abstract movement for ball using Choreograph
* Create different levels of rigor 
    * Based on speed and distractions

Week 3:
* Add any additional tests
* Add a leaderboard
* Add special effects and music

**STRETCH GOALS:**
If I were to finish this project early, I would work on adding 3D graphics to the game.
